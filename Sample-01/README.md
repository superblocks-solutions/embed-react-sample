# Superblocks Embed React SDK Sample Application

This sample demonstrates the integration of [Superblocks Embed React SDK](https://github.com/superblocksteam/embed-react) into a React application created using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## Project setup

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Start Embedding

Go to the [Superblocks docs](https://docs-git-embedded-app-beta-superblocks.vercel.app/applications/embedded-apps/) to learn how to embed a Superblocks App into the app.
